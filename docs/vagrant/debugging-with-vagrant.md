If you have installed vagrant using a package manager, and are having problems running vagrant, e.g.:

```
zsh: /usr/bin/vagrant: bad interpreter: /usr/bin/ruby: no such file or directory
```

...then removing the package and installing Vagrant from a package downloaded from [the Vagrant web site](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) will probably solve the problem. (See [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43813735/cannot-start-vagrant-ubuntu-16-04) for more detail.)
