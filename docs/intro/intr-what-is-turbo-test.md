# ðŸš  Overview

[Turbo Test](https://turbo-test.com/) runs your software tests in parallel on the cloud, drastically reducing testing time and increasing developer productivity.

Turbo Test is designed to be simple to configure and use. Once you've configured it, whenever you push your changes to Github, Turbo Test will automatically run your tests for you.

Here is all you need to do to start using it:

* sign up for the service
* install the application onto your Github account...
* ...including specifying which repos on which you want to run TurboTest
* for each repo, configure a .turbo\_test.yml file.

You do not need to sign up for the cloud resources used to perform the tests -- we do that for you, and the costs are included in your subscription.

We recommend familiarizing yourself with Turbo Test at first with a repo whose tests are not too time consuming. This will give you faster feedback while you are learning.

We provide the [sample sandbox repo](https://github.com/turbotest/HELP/tree/0780d8836376fd9fe9b775a5f53f6abf73642215/sandbox/README.md) as an even easier starting point, as it already has a working configuration file.

Here are the sections of this documentation and how they will help you:
