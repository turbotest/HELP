# Turbo Test

Turbo Test runs your software tests in parallel on the cloud, drastically reducing testing time and increasing developer productivity.

Turbo Test is designed to be simple to configure and use. Here is all you need to do to start using it:

* sign up for the service
* install the application onto your Github account...
* ...including specifying which repos on which you want to run TurboTest
* for each repo, configure the .turbo_test.yml file.

You do not need to sign up for the cloud resources used to perform the tests -- we do that for you.
