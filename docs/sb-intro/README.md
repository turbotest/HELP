# Using the sandbox repository

The [sandbox repo](https://github.com/turbotest/sandbox) is a minimal sample repo with which you can familiarize yourself with Turbo Test.

Although you are free to clone it, you will probably want to fork it so that you can run tests on it with Turbo Test. (Turbo Test will only run on Github repos that you own.)
