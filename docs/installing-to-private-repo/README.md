# Installing to Your Private Repo

This section describes how you can get TurboTest up and running on one of your Github repos. This repo can be your "real" repo, or you may want to use a smaller private test repo to start.

There are two steps:

1. Installing Turbo Test to your Github account and repo
2. Configuring Turbo Test (the .turbo\_test.yml file)
