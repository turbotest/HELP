# Installing Turbo Test to Your Repo

In order to get TurboTest up and running on one of your Github repos, you will need to:

1. [Install Turbo Test to your Github account](../github-app) andd attach it to your repo
2. [Configure Turbo Test](../config-file)] (with the `.turbo\_test.yml` file)

Attaching your repo to Turbo Test can be done either on initial installation of Turbo Test, or later, by going to 
[the Turbo Test web site](https://turbo-test.com/) and clicking the "INSTALL" link.

If your tests take a long time to run, you might want to start out using and experimenting
with a more lightweight repo to get familiar with Turbo Test more quickly.
