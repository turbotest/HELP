# Using the Sandbox Repo

The [sandbox repo](https://github.com/turbotest/sandbox) is a minimal sample repo with which you can familiarize yourself with Turbo Test and experiment with it.
 
You may want to fork it so that you can push any changes you make up to Github as a backup. If not, here are the URL's for cloning:

* git - [git@github.com:turbotest/sandbox.git](git@github.com:turbotest/sandbox.git)
* https - [https://github.com/turbotest/sandbox.git](https://github.com/turbotest/sandbox.git)
