The first step is to install the TurboTest application to your Github account:

1. Go to https://github.com in your web browser, and log in to your Github account.
1. Open a new tab or window in the browser, and go to https://turbo-test.com. You will be redirected to a github.com authorization page.
1. Click the green "Authorize turbotest" button. You will be forwarded to turbo-test.com.
1. Click the blue "Install" link at the top.
1. Decide whether you want to install to all your repos, or just selected ones, and click the appropriate radio button.
1. If you selected "Only selected repositories", select the repositories to which you want to install Turbo Test.
1. Click the green "Install" button at the bottom of the page.
1. Input your password and click the green "Confirm password" button.
1. You will be brought to the Turbo Test page. If you see a message saying "Please install turbotest github application on one of your repositories", refresh the page. (This will be fixed soon.)

That's it, you're done. You will see all the repos on which you installed Turbo Test with the text "waiting for first build..." beside them.
