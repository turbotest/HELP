# Turbo Test

Turbo Test runs your software tests in parallel on the cloud, drastically reducing testing time and increasing developer productivity.

Like the proverbial Unix command line utility, it is not designed with a kitchen sink of functionality unrelated to its mission; instead, it does one thing and one thing well -- it runs your tests in a small fraction of the time it takes you now.
 
Turbo Test is designed to be simple to configure and use. Here is all you need to do to start using it:

* sign up for the service
* install the application onto your Github account
* configure the test runs in your .turbo_test.yml file.

You do not need to sign up for the cloud resources used to perform the tests -- we do that for you. Our goal is to offload from you as much as possible so you can focus on what you do best -- creating great software.
